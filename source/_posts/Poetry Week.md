A fragment from the poem **‘zonder handen, zonder tanden’** from the Week of Poetry Gift *Vrij – Wij?* from **Tom Lanoye** in light of the [Week of Poetry 2019](https://www.poezieweek.com/).

The image is generated based on a script written in Processing. It highlights the duality between the theme of the poem - freedom - and the 'lack of freedom' in a rule based script. Each punctuation mark has been replaced by an abstract figure. Each figure caries rules concerning rotation and randomness.
By partially randomizing the output, the visual changes upon every refresh.
